A Firebase binding which uses **luasec** for **https**.

You will need this

```
sudo luarocks install LuaSec
sudo luarocks install lua-cjson
```

and the `firebase.lua` file which is **not yet** on LuaRocks. Just get it from the repository.

### How to use?

Check the wiki for examples.

### ZeroBrane Studio API

There is an API script included that you can use for autocomplete in ZBS :smile:
